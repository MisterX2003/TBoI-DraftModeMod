    <description>[h1]Ever wanted to play the game a little differently, then draft mode might be for you![/h1]

[b]Inspired by the older but now deprecated and broken draft mode mod by RedOrangeJuice, and was able to work perfectly with the help of pedroff_1 and hgrfff, comes the new repentance supporting draft mode![/b]

This mod changes the game so that instead of getting an item after defeating a boss, you are allowed to choose one item from four randomly generated options pulled from the boss item pool at the start of each floor.
After choosing, the other options disappear, and you get no item for defeating the boss.

There are notable changes from the original, such as:
[b] [list]
[*]Not being limited to a challenge
[*]Not breaking replaced characters
[*]Works with curses/challenges.
[*]Works with any moddable version of TBoI
[*]Supports multiplayer (AB+/REP.)
[*]Works with alt. paths/tainted characters (REP.)
[*]Extremely compatible with mods and any combination of DLC.
[*]Very flexible/versatile with configuration for user enjoyment
[/list][/b]
The mod has support for the mod configuration menu!
You can currently configure:
[b] [list]
[*]If the mode is currently on
[*]If achievements/unlocks are disabled
[*]The itempool the items are pulled from or how they are pulled
[*]The amount of drafted items you get to choose from
[*]Minimum/Maximum quality of items (REP.)
[*]Whether or not active items can be drafted
[*]Whether or not duplicates can be drafted
[*]Whether or not items disappear after choosing one
[*]If boss rewards are enabled/disabled
[*]If item room rewards are enabled/disabled
[*]If other types of item rooms are enabled/disabled
[*]What stage items stop being drafted
[*]What item pools are available for random selection for random indiv./overall item pool configuration
[*]Current configuration preset
[/list][/b]
It supports XL floors in the way you'd expect it to, and it also allows for identical replication of drafts through seeds. (Assuming you have the same pool selected too, except for universal)
Also, it supports the MinimapAPI for added functionality.
(with regards to removing treasure rooms if desired)

[b][u]Cliff-Notes: [list]
[*]Mod-Configuration menu isn't a total requirement, but it makes the mod 100x better and more interesting/unique, but again it will work in a fine and balanced way without it.
[*]Repentance owners get better functionality and more configuration due to API and content additions exclusive to repentance, but it still works fine with AB+.
[*]Also, with every update that may add/change pools and their configuration your config data may be reset.
