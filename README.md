# TBoI-DraftModeMod
Ever wanted to play the game a little differently, then draft mode might be for you!

Inspired by the older but now deprecated and broken draft mode mod by RedOrangeJuice, and was able to work perfectly with the help of pedroff_1 and hgrfff, comes the new repentance supporting draft mode!

This mod changes the game so that instead of getting an item after defeating a boss, you are allowed to choose one item from four randomly generated options pulled from the boss item pool at the start of each floor.
After choosing, the other options disappear, and you get no item for defeating the boss.

There are notable changes from the original, such as:
Not being limited to a challenge
Not breaking replaced characters
Works with curses/challenges.
Works with any moddable version of TBoI
Supports multiplayer (AB+/REP.)
Works with alt. paths/tainted characters (REP.)
Extremely compatible with mods and any combination of DLC.
Very flexible/versatile with configuration for user enjoyment

The mod has support for the mod configuration menu!
You can currently configure:
If the mode is currently on
If achievements/unlocks are disabled
The itempool the items are pulled from or how they are pulled
The amount of drafted items you get to choose from
Minimum/Maximum quality of items (REP.)
Whether or not active items can be drafted
Whether or not duplicates can be drafted
Whether or not items disappear after choosing one
If boss rewards are enabled/disabled
If item room rewards are enabled/disabled
If other types of item rooms are enabled/disabled
What stage items stop being drafted
What item pools are available for random selection for random indiv./overall item pool configuration
Current configuration preset

It supports XL floors in the way you'd expect it to, and it also allows for identical replication of drafts through seeds. (Assuming you have the same pool selected too, except for universal)
Also, it supports the MinimapAPI for added functionality.
(with regards to removing treasure rooms if desired)

Cliff-Notes:
Mod-Configuration menu isn't a total requirement, but it makes the mod 100x better and more interesting/unique, but again it will work in a fine and balanced way without it.
Repentance owners get better functionality and more configuration due to API and content additions exclusive to repentance, but it still works fine with AB+.
Also, with every update that may add/change pools and their configuration your config data may be reset.

If you find any bugs or have feedback, feel free to post in the discussion, thanks for viewing!
